Hi, I’m @bjkeefe.

I’m currently learning (teaching myself, mostly, thanks to the myriad of resources out there) Python, Sphinx, and Git.
Consequently, pretty much everything that I have on this site at the moment and in the near future will be stuff that's
created as part of the learning process.  Most likely, it won't be much use to anybody else, except possibly to others
at a similar stage in the learning process.  Or, perhaps, as examples of how not to do something.

So, feel free to copy, reuse, modify, etc., anything you see here, but please do *not* rely on anything I've posted here
for anything that is even remotely critical. No warranty, expressed or implied, etc.

Criticism is welcome.

You can reach me at twitter.com/bjkeefe, facebook.com/bjkeefe, and on Gmail (same handle).
